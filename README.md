# shortest_path_for_moving
#There are N houses in a certain village.
#A single villager lives in each of the houses. The houses are connected by roads. 
#Each road connects two houses and is exactly 1 kilometer long. From each house it is possible to reach any other using one or several consecutive roads. 
#In total there are N − 1 roads in the village.

#One day all villagers decided to move to different houses—that is, after moving each house should again have a single villager living in it, 
#but no villager should be living in the same house as before. 
#We would like to know the smallest and the largest possible total lengths in kilometers of the shortest paths between the old and the new houses for all villagers.

#this is a program that finds the smallest and the largest total lengths of the shortest paths in kilometers 
#and an example assignment of the new houses to the villagers for each of the two cases.
